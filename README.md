# ADVENTURE-GAME

## The program is a text-based adventure game where players navigate through different scenarios by making choices. After entering their name, players choose between going left or right. If they go left, they encounter a river and must decide whether to swim or walk around it, each choice leading to different outcomes. Opting to go right leads to crossing a shaky bridge where they encounter a stranger; choosing to interact with the stranger could result in winning or losing the game. Invalid choices result in losing, and regardless of the outcome, the game thanks the player for participating. Overall, it's an engaging and interactive experience where players shape the course of their adventure through their decisions.
